# Numerical Algorithms

#### -- Project Status: [Active / On-Hold]

## Project Intro/Objective

This is a collection of numerical computing / methods common in computational physics. The algoritms are implemented in C++. Often, the C++ program will perform the intensive calculations, and output the results to a csv file. It would be easy for one to plot the results and perform data visualization by writing Python scripts.
